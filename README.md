# Network Server
A simple implementation of a network collector service which reads host metrics of a system and pushes them down a TCP stream to be stored in a database. Includes a very simple front-end to render those metrics back out based on a collectors UUID. Written through following the Ardan Labs Ultimate Rust Foundations course.
